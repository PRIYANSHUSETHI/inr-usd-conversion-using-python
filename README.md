# USD to INR Conversion Rate Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts the USD to INR conversion rate using historical exchange rate data. It involves data preprocessing, visualization, and forecasting using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used contains historical exchange rates between USD and INR. It includes date-wise records of exchange rates, particularly the closing price.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy (Data manipulation and analysis)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly (Data visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Machine learning model)

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Load the dataset using `pandas.read_csv()`.
- Check for missing values and remove any inconsistencies.
- Convert date formats and extract essential features such as year and month.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Generate summary statistics to understand the dataset.
- Visualize the historical exchange rate trends using line charts.
- Analyze yearly and monthly trends to identify patterns.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Create new features based on extracted date information.
- Prepare data by splitting it into training and testing sets.

### 4. Model Development & Training
- Select an appropriate regression model for time series forecasting.
- Train the model using the historical exchange rate data.
- Evaluate model performance using RMSE and RÂ² score.

### 5. Prediction & Forecasting
- Use the trained model to predict future exchange rates.
- Compare actual vs predicted values and visualize results.
- Identify potential trends and fluctuations in exchange rates.

### 6. Future Enhancements
- Experiment with advanced models like LSTM or ARIMA for improved accuracy.
- Integrate external economic indicators to enhance predictions.
- Deploy the model as a real-time forecasting tool.

## Results
- The model successfully predicts future exchange rates with reasonable accuracy.
- Data visualizations provide insights into trends and fluctuations over the years.

## Future Improvements
- Improve model accuracy using advanced algorithms like LSTM or ARIMA.
- Incorporate additional economic indicators for better predictions.
